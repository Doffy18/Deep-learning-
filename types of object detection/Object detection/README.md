# Object Detection using YOLO

## Overview
The `object_detection_using_yolo.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the implementation of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for real-time object detection. This project explores preprocessing, model configuration, and inference for detecting objects in images and videos with high accuracy and speed.

## Features
- **YOLO Framework**:
  - Configures YOLO model parameters and architecture.
  - Utilizes pre-trained weights or allows training from scratch.
- **Image and Video Detection**: Detects and classifies objects in static images and video streams.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Resizes images to YOLO's input dimensions.
  - Applies normalization and bounding box scaling.
- **Visualization**: Draws bounding boxes and class labels on detected objects.
- **Custom Training** (optional): Trains YOLO on custom datasets for specific object categories.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following dependencies are installed in your Python environment:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- numpy
- matplotlib
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on the YOLO implementation)
- YOLO-specific tools and configurations (e.g., Darknet for YOLOv3, PyTorch Hub for YOLOv5)

## Usage
### Notebook
1. Clone this repository or download the `object_detection_using_yolo.ipynb` notebook.
2. Prepare the required weights file (e.g., `yolov3.weights`) and configuration files (`yolov3.cfg`).
3. Place your test images and videos in the specified directories.
4. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or a compatible IDE.
5. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load YOLO configurations and weights.
   - Perform object detection on input images or videos.
   - Visualize the detection results.

### Example Command (if using YOLO via command-line):
```bash
!darknet detector test cfg/coco.data cfg/yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights data/sample.jpg
```

## Datasets
For custom training, prepare your dataset in YOLO format:
- Images stored in a directory.
- Corresponding `.txt` files with annotations (class_id, x_center, y_center, width, height).

Update the configuration file to reflect dataset specifics:
- Number of classes.
- Paths to training/validation data.

## Outputs
The notebook produces:
- Detected images and videos with bounding boxes.
- Model performance metrics (if custom training is performed).

## Notes
- Use a GPU for faster inference and training.
- Customize confidence thresholds and non-max suppression (NMS) settings to improve detection quality.
- Experiment with YOLOv3, YOLOv4, or YOLOv5 based on project requirements.
