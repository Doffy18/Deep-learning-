# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## Overview
The `gan.ipynb` notebook explores the implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic data generation. It demonstrates the architecture, training process, and evaluation of GANs, focusing on their ability to generate realistic data samples from noise.

## Features
- **Model Implementation**: 
  - Constructs a **Generator** to create synthetic data samples from latent noise.
  - Implements a **Discriminator** to classify real and generated samples.
- **Training Process**: 
  - Trains both networks iteratively with the adversarial approach.
  - Demonstrates stability tricks such as learning rate adjustments, batch normalization, and gradient clipping.
- **Evaluation**: 
  - Visualizes generated data samples to assess the quality of the output.
  - Tracks model performance using metrics such as loss curves for both the Generator and Discriminator.
- **Applications**: Generates data for use cases such as image generation, signal synthesis, or augmenting datasets.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following dependencies are installed in your Python environment:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- numpy
- matplotlib
- keras
- pandas (if required for preprocessing)

## Usage
### Notebook
1. Clone this repository or download the `gan.ipynb` notebook.
2. Prepare your training dataset and specify its path within the notebook.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or a compatible IDE.
4. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, build the GAN architecture, train the model, and visualize the results.

## Datasets
The notebook is flexible with datasets but primarily supports image datasets formatted in standard directories or arrays. Examples include:
- **MNIST**: Handwritten digit images.
- **CIFAR-10**: Colored natural images across 10 classes.

Data preparation includes resizing and normalizing images to ensure compatibility with the model.

## Outputs
The GAN generates:
- **Synthetic Samples**: Visualizations of generated data (e.g., images) at different epochs.
- **Training Metrics**: Loss curves for Generator and Discriminator to track progress.
- **Saved Models**: Optionally saves trained Generator and Discriminator models.

## Notes
- Experiment with hyperparameters like latent space dimensions, learning rates, and network depth to optimize performance.
- Advanced extensions include Conditional GANs (CGANs) and StyleGAN for specific tasks.

## Acknowledgments
This project demonstrates the power of GANs for data generation, making it a valuable tool for research and industry applications where real data is scarce or inaccessible.
