## Toxic Comment Detection
## Overview
The toxic.ipynb notebook focuses on identifying toxic language in text data. It includes preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and the development of machine learning models for text classification.

# Features
Text Preprocessing: Cleans text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters, and applies tokenization.
EDA: Explores the distribution of toxic and non-toxic labels and provides visual insights into word frequency and class imbalance.
Modeling: Implements machine learning and deep learning models to classify text as toxic or non-toxic.
Evaluation: Analyzes model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

#Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed in your Python environment:

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
nltk
tensorflow/keras (for deep learning models)
matplotlib
seaborn

# Usage
Notebook
Clone this repository or download the toxic.ipynb notebook.
Load the dataset containing labeled text (e.g., toxic or non-toxic).
Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE.
Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, perform analysis, and build models.

# Datasets
The notebook requires a labeled dataset with columns for text content and corresponding labels (e.g., "toxic", "non-toxic"). Ensure the dataset is structured to align with the notebook's preprocessing steps.

# Outputs
The notebook generates:

Cleaned text data.
Visualizations of word distributions and label imbalances.
Classification model performance metrics.
Predictions for unseen text data.

# Notes

Fine-tune preprocessing and model parameters based on the specific dataset and objectives.
Experiment with advanced models (e.g., transformers) to improve performance.
# Acknowledgments
This project applies text preprocessing, machine learning, and deep learning to address challenges in identifying toxic language effectively.
