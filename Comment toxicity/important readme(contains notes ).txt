notes:

Tokenization:
Definition: Tokenization is the process of splitting a text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens could be words, characters, or even subwords, depending on the tokenization method.
Example: The sentence "I love coding!" becomes ["I", "love", "coding", "!"] with word-level tokenization.
Focus: Tokenization is mainly about breaking down the text into meaningful chunks or tokens.

Text Vectorization:
Definition: Vectorization goes a step further by converting the tokens into numerical representations. In the case of the TextVectorization layer, each token (like a word) is mapped to a unique integer. The vectorization layer also handles padding/truncation to make all sequences the same length.
Example: After tokenizing the sentence "I love coding!", the words might be mapped to numbers like [23, 45, 678, 9].
Focus: Vectorization not only breaks down the text but also transforms it into a format (numbers) that machine learning models can work with.

In most cases, tools like TensorFlow’s TextVectorization layer combine both steps internally. So when you use the TextVectorization layer, it automatically tokenizes the text and converts tokens into numbers, meaning you don't need a separate tokenization step.


Word2Vec provides dense vector representations where similar words have similar vectors. This captures word relationships and meaning, which basic integer-based TextVectorization doesn't. using tokenization (e.g., NLTK) + Word2Vec for embeddings is a great approach when you want to leverage meaningful word vectors, especially for more complex text tasks. It’s generally more powerful than simple TextVectorization, which just converts words to integers without capturing their meaning.

so we 1st tokenize then use word2vec or glove.

DOUBT CLEARED

TextVectorization:
max_tokens=10000: Your model can learn up to 10,000 unique words (vocabulary size). Each word gets a unique number (0-9999).
output_sequence_length=1800: All input sentences are converted into sequences of exactly 1800 tokens (words).
Short sentences are padded with zeros (to make them 1800 tokens long).
Long sentences are cut off at 1800 tokens.
Embedding:
input_dim=10000: The Embedding layer takes token numbers (0-9999) from TextVectorization and turns each one into a vector.
output_dim: This defines how large the vectors are for each word (e.g., 128).
Example Flow:
Input text like "The cat sat on the mat" gets turned into 1800 tokens.
Each token (word) is a number between 0 and 9999.
The Embedding layer turns these numbers into vectors.
In short, max_tokens limits how many words you can handle, output_sequence_length makes sure all inputs have 1800 tokens, and the Embedding layer converts these numbers into vectors.



You said:
so basically the embedding layer will get 10k words as input. bt during training wht if vectorization layer only get 2 sentences and assigns only numbers from 1 to 10 as its ony 2sentences...

You're right! If the TextVectorization layer sees only 2 sentences during training, it will assign numbers only to the words in those sentences. So, let’s say there are only 10 unique words in those two sentences, the TextVectorization layer will only use numbers from 1 to 10 to represent those words.

But here’s how it works in the context of training:

Scenario:
Two Sentences Example:
Sentence 1: "The cat sat on the mat."
Sentence 2: "The dog barked loudly."
Let's say there are 10 unique words across both sentences.
What Happens:
TextVectorization:
Only 10 unique words are found, so the words will be mapped to integers like:
"The" → 1
"cat" → 2
"sat" → 3
"on" → 4
"the" → 5 (repeats are handled)
"mat" → 6
"dog" → 7
"barked" → 8
"loudly" → 9
You will only see numbers between 1 and 9 for these specific words.
Embedding Layer:
The Embedding layer expects numbers between 0 and 9999 (because of input_dim=10000), but since you're only using 9 unique tokens, it will use embeddings for numbers 1 to 9 during training.
Important Points:
Unused Vocabulary: Even though the TextVectorization layer can handle up to 10,000 words, it will only assign numbers for words it actually sees in the data (in this case, only 9 words).

Later Training: As you train with more sentences, more unique words will appear, and the TextVectorization layer will assign more numbers (tokens) until it reaches the max_tokens limit of 10,000.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Learns Vocabulary:

When you call .adapt() on the TextVectorization layer, it goes through your dataset and collects the most frequent words, assigning them unique numbers (up to max_tokens).
For example, if max_tokens=10000, it will learn the 10,000 most frequent words and map them to integers (e.g., "the" → 1, "cat" → 2, etc.).
Prepares the Layer for Tokenization:

After calling .adapt(), the layer knows how to convert raw text into sequences of integers, and it can handle new text inputs accordingly.

==================================================================================

1. Tokenization:
Tokenization is the process of converting a text into individual units called tokens. These tokens can be words, characters, or subwords. In NLP, word tokenization is common, where a sentence is split into words.

Example:
Input sentence: "The cat sat on the mat."
Tokenized: ['The', 'cat', 'sat', 'on', 'the', 'mat', '.']
Here’s a simple visualization of tokenization:

css
Copy code
Input: "The cat sat on the mat."
        ↓
Output: ['The', 'cat', 'sat', 'on', 'the', 'mat', '.']
2. Text Vectorization:
Text vectorization refers to converting text tokens into numerical form so they can be used by machine learning models. Common methods include one-hot encoding or TF-IDF.

Example:
For one-hot encoding:

Vocabulary: ['The', 'cat', 'sat', 'on', 'mat']

Each word is represented by a vector, where only one position corresponding to the word is 1, and the rest are 0.

The: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

cat: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

sat: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

on: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

mat: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

lua
Copy code
Input: ['The', 'cat', 'sat', 'on', 'mat']
        ↓
Output: [[1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]
3. Word Embedding Layer:
Word embeddings map words to dense vectors of real numbers, capturing their semantic meaning. Models like Word2Vec or GloVe generate embeddings, and in deep learning, a neural network layer (Embedding Layer) learns this.

Example:
The embedding layer converts tokens into dense vectors. For example, "The cat sat" might be mapped into vectors:

The: [0.25, 0.78, 0.56, 0.45]
cat: [0.66, 0.21, 0.89, 0.10]
sat: [0.14, 0.89, 0.44, 0.68]
lua
Copy code
Input: ['The', 'cat', 'sat']
        ↓
Embedding Layer
        ↓
Output: [[0.25, 0.78, 0.56, 0.45],
         [0.66, 0.21, 0.89, 0.10],
         [0.14, 0.89, 0.44, 0.68]]
This output shows each word represented by a dense vector with continuous values.

4. Flatten Layer:
The flatten layer in deep learning is used to convert a multi-dimensional matrix (e.g., 2D or 3D) into a 1D vector. This is typically used before passing data to fully connected layers.

Example:
If you have a matrix (e.g., a feature map in a convolutional neural network) like:

lua
Copy code
[[0.25, 0.78],
 [0.66, 0.21]]
The flatten layer will convert this into a 1D vector:

makefile
Copy code
Flatten: [0.25, 0.78, 0.66, 0.21]
Combined Flow in a Neural Network:
Input: "The cat sat"
Tokenized: ['The', 'cat', 'sat']
Embedding Layer: Converts to dense vectors.
Flatten Layer: Flattens the 2D matrix to a 1D vector.
This process allows the text to be processed by a neural network!
