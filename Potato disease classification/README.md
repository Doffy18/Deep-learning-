# Potato Disease Detection

## Overview
The `potato.ipynb` notebook provides a comprehensive framework for detecting diseases in potato plant leaves using image classification techniques. It leverages deep learning models to classify leaf images into healthy or diseased categories, assisting in precision agriculture.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Performs image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes the dataset to understand class distribution and sample images.
- **Model Development**: 
  - Implements convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.
  - Offers integration with pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG) for transfer learning.
- **Model Training**: Fine-tunes the model using loss functions and optimizers to achieve high accuracy.
- **Evaluation and Inference**: Evaluates the model with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. Allows predictions on new images.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed in your Python environment:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- keras
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- opencv-python

## Usage
### Notebook
1. Clone this repository or download the `potato.ipynb` notebook.
2. Place the dataset (e.g., images of healthy and diseased potato leaves) in the specified directory.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or a compatible IDE.
4. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Preprocess the dataset.
   - Train and evaluate the model.
   - Predict the health status of new leaf images.

## Datasets
The notebook requires a labeled dataset with:
- **Healthy Potato Leaves**
- **Diseased Potato Leaves** (e.g., Late Blight)

Ensure the dataset is structured as:
```
/data
  /healthy
  /diseased
```

## Outputs
The project generates:
- Trained models saved for deployment.
- Classification results with accuracy and visualization of predictions.
- Processed datasets ready for additional analysis.

## Notes
- Modify image preprocessing and model architecture based on dataset characteristics.
- Use GPU acceleration for faster training if handling a large dataset.

## Acknowledgments
This project integrates computer vision and agriculture, helping farmers detect plant diseases early and take preventative measures effectively.
